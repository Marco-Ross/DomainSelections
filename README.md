#METRO TRANSIT

##Transportation services.

###Sub-domain: Railway transportation


Cape Town Metro Rail is in a terrible state at the moment. Things such as pointless travel classes, delayed trains because of poor communication, and a system where you keep a ticket on your person for an entire month, as well as long queues and waiting times etc. A paper system given enough time will soon become out of date. It also costs metro excessive amounts to produce these tickets with all the ink and paper usage.

The system would be so much more efficient if there was even a bit more automation. Less errors would occur, estimated departure and arrival times would be more accurate, proper updates about train schedules would alleviate uncertainty, allowing people to find other modes of transport if delays are too long.

In terms of commuters for the new system, they would create an account on the metro system with all his/her information, be able to check prices, check accurate schedules, make purchases online to avoid ques, see how long they would travel for exactly, plus getting rid of weekly and monthly tickets, being able to choose how long they want to travel for, and being able to refund their money.

When it comes to issues outside of the systems capabilities, user interaction would still be necessary, e.g. issues on the rail, the driver would be able to look for alternate routes on the system. If there was a train that broke down, a person would have to enter an estimated delay time, but this personâ€™s job would be to monitor the railway.

By and large, the system would greatly improve railway transportation and try to make everything as smooth as possible.
